# ArduinoFibonacci
Arduino sketch to implement a web app that calculates fibonacci values:

Assuming you've configured your Arduino YUN Wifi connection, follow these steps:
1.- Clone this into your computer
2.- Connect your computer to the same network that is your Arduino YUN connected
3.- Upload this sketch to your Arduino YUN
3.- Open your web browser and enter: 
  a.- ARDUINO_IP_ADDRESS/arduino/fibonacci/N -> To calculate the fibonacci on N
  b.- ARDUINO_IP_ADDRESS/arduino/sequence/N -> To calculate all values of fibonacci until fib(N)
